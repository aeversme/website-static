# Profile Website (static)

This is the static version of my portfolio website for deployment to AWS S3. The original site is based around a Flask 
application and deployed to AWS via Elastic Beanstalk. To reduce costs, I have refactored the HTML and will deploy this
simpler version going forward.

The repository for the original webapp can be found [here](https://github.com/aeversme/portfolio-webapp).
